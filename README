Vim swoop is directly inspired from helm-swoop we can find as emacs' plugin.

It allows you to find and replace occurences in many buffers being aware of the context.

Feel free to go to the git repo so see an animation and picture.

You can edit the swoopBuffer and the changes you applied will be save for all corresponding files by saving the buffer

Especially useful to refactor a name in multiple files and keep control on it...


------  Usage  -----

When you start vim-swoop (multi or single buffer mode) you get 2 windows.

First one contain context, the other is the swoop buffer. As you move the cursor to a match, the display windows will show the context.

From the swoop buffer, you can:
* Interactivly edit your search
* Navigate in results (and context) by moving the cursor
* Select current result.
*Exit Swoop and go to the location of current match when you press \<CR\>*
* Edit and save Swoop Buffer.
*The changes will be repercuted on all files by saving the Swoop Buffer*
* Quit Swoop.
*Exiting Swoop will bring you back to the initial buffer and position.*
* Toggle single and multi buffer mode

-- single buffer mode --
Start in insert mode, first line contains the search pattern.

As you type the pattern, results will interactivly be displayed bellow.


-- multi buffer mode --
Start in insert mode, first line contains the buffer pattern, no pattern means all buffers.

Buffer will be displayed interactivly bellow

Second line contains the search pattern just like in single buffer mode


-----  Commands and Configuration  -----

-- Commands --
* Swoop current Buffer
nmap <Leader>l :call Swoop()<CR>

* Swoop multi Buffers
nmap <Leader>ml :call SwoopMulti()<CR>

-- Configuration --

* Disable quick regex mode

    By default, typing \<Space\> in the search pattern is replaced by ".*". You can get classic mode by:
let s:regexMode = 0

-----  Tips and Tricks  -----

* Use CursorLine

    I strongly advise to highlight current line. It will help you to keep focus on the context of the current match.

* FileType and Session
    
    If you use [Vim-session](https://github.com/xolox/vim-session), be aware that it doesn't keep buffer filetype in memory.

    I'm working on this issue.

* Toggle mode

    You can toggle single and multi buffer mode, your Pattern will stay the same.

    Calling again a mode while your already in will reset the search pattern.

* Search in swoop buffer

    Since the context display depends of the cursor movement, you can lauch a search inside the search buffer

* Use last search

    When you start swoop (either the mode) and don't enter any pattern, search result will be your last search.



-----  Upcomming feature and improvement  -----
* Display empty buffer in display window when no context available (ie pattern or buffer name)
* Swoop Current selection
* Improve swoop Colors in console
* Option to choose display windows place
* SmartCase search
